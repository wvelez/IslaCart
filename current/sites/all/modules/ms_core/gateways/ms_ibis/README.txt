-- SUMMARY --
Integrated Merchant Agent (IMA) for linking the merchant to the IBIS payment
system.

-- INSTALLATION --
1. Enable the module
2. Go to Admin -> MoneyScripts -> Gateways -> IBIS
3. Open Server settings fieldset, configure as needed.
You need keystore file, generated by instructions of First Data. So, to use this
payment method, website owner should need to have signed First Data application.
IMPORTANT! You need to define full path to keystore file. For security issues,
do not place it in Drupal root directory.
